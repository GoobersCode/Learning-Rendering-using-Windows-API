# Learning Rendering using Windows API
 
The purpose of this project is for me to learn how to
do rendering using the Win32 API.  I also aim to make
a  3D  game  in  which  everything  is  mendable  and 
breakable, and there is no inventory. It will be low-
poly if need be. If this doesn't work as planned,   I 
will come up with some other idea for a game or simi-
ler to the current one.
